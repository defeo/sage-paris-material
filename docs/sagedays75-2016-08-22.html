# SageMath mini-history

- 1999-2005: "William Stein writes over 25,000 lines of Magma code for
  his research, and realizes that Magma was a bad long term investment
  since he couldn't see or modify the internals."
- Feb. 2005: Sage 0.1, a Python library linking
  PARI, Maxima, Python, Singular, GAP.
- Fev. 2006: Sage 1.0
  Sage Days 1, San Diego, 10 participants?
- Fev. 2010: Sage 4.4.2
  Sage Days 20, Luminy (France), 120 participants
- Current version: SageMath 7.3

# Free as in *freedom*

> “You can read Sylow’s Theorem and its proof in Huppert's book in the
> library... then you can use Sylow’s Theorem for the rest of your
> life free of charge, but for many computer algebra systems license
> fees have to be paid regularly...  With this situation two of
> the most basic rules of conduct in mathematics are violated: In
> mathematics information is passed on free of charge and everything

# Freedom to run

On any machine, for any (legal) use.

## Freedom to give away copies

(Also to sell them!)

Why?

- (kind of) easy to install and maintain at your university
- Students can use at home
- Run computations remotely, scale freely
- Share programs, notebooks
- Free for anyone, even with limited resources
- No costs for developing countries


---

# Freedom to study the code

Open source: you can read what it does

Why?

- Pedagogy
- Dissemination
- Expressive, readable, (kind of) well documented code
- Reproducibility of scientific results
- Verify (simple) proofs
- Master hypotheses, models, algorithms
- Analyze bugs and weird behaviors 

---

# Freedom to contribute

Why?

- Fix bugs
- Write documentation
- Write localizations
- Domain specific development
- Share code
- Engage with a community

---

# `SageMath == Python`

Python is an interpreted multi-paradigm programming language

Easy to use, like a pocket calculator

~~~
python: x = 17
python: x
17
python: 3*x
51
~~~

Easy to read and write:

math: {17x | x ∈ {0, 1,... , 9} and x is odd }

python: `{ 17*x for x in range(10) if x%2 == 1 }`

# Python is extremely popular

- Among the 5 most used programming languages

> “Google has made no secret of the fact they use Python a lot for a
>number of internal projects. Even knowing that, once I was an
>employee, I was amazed at how much Python code there actually is in
>the Google source code system.”
>
> — Guido van Rossum (créateur de Python)

- Many libraries available in Python: data bases,
  graphics, network, parallel computing...
- Easy to interface with C/C++/Fortran
- Cython: Python ↔ C
- Python has become a *de facto* standard in scientific computing.
